    <p>
        I am a Software Engineering student at the Politecnico di Milano, currently about to start my second year. 
        I am characterized by a strong curiosity, especially in the tech field, and I enjoy expanding my knowledge,
         particularly through reading books.

        Since the beginning of my academic journey, I have developed a passion for programming. 
        I have experience with various programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++,
        and I am constantly exploring new tools and methodologies to improve my skills.
