Introduction ; Regression to something that is not linear, using functions like tanh, problem of dead neuaron, vanishing or eploding gradients, architecture built from scratch using piece of code for doing things written in plain python with references to the torch documentation.

## Introduction

In this third post, we are taking another step forward in our journey. This time, we will make our neural network capable of classification. Specifically, we want our model to predict a character, which essentially turns this into a classification problem. If this souns weird, wait until the end of the post and you are going to understand!
